The client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source
of income for a bank.
The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their
customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing
and digital marketing.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way
to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call
centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial
to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can
be specifically targeted via call.
The Data provided contains: age of the client, their job
type, their marital status, duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc. Given this information,
My task is to predict ifthe client will subscribe to term deposit so the Telephonic Sales Excecutives can save their time and money


The Repo contains Train.csv(data for training the model), Test.csv(data to predict on), project.ipynb(codes)
